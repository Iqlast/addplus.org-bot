🔥 Selling AddPlus.org Airdrop Points – Up to 50% OFF Manual Claim
I'm offering pre-claimed AddPlus.org Boost Points for those who want to skip the hassle of manual claiming, login, and follow requirements.

Each claimed link equals 50 points, which AddPlus.org states are worth $0.125 based on their airdrop whitepaper (1 USDA = $1 stable equivalent).

💸 My Offer
✅ 50 Points (1 Claim)
Only $0.06 per link – 50% cheaper than manual claim value
(Fair price considering time saved, X account limits, and FCFS risk)

🧾 Discounts for bulk orders (100+ claims)

📌 How It Works
You provide your AddPlus account or claim endpoint

I send you claimed points using unique X accounts (already connected & clean)

You instantly receive 50 points per link on your AddPlus dashboard

FCFS system – we help you claim before it's too late

⚙️ Technical Details
All points are claimed using verified X accounts

Unique device fingerprints used per claim

Random delay & anti-bot safe

Residential proxy support for safety
